# Agentic AI Lab 

This project demonstrates the basic steps of creating an AI Agent with Camunda.

## Technical pre-requisites
1. Cluster 8.8.0-alpha5
2. GMail account to send emails (or any other email provider that you have access to to send emails)
3. Connector secret: ```GOOGLE_MAIL_USERNAME```
4. Connector secret: ```GOOGLE_MAIL_PASSWORD```
5. OpenAI account with access to gpt-4.1 (gpt-4o never calls the email tool...)  
6. Connector secret: ```OPENAI_API_KEY```

The Google Password is NOT your user password, you must create an application password:
https://myaccount.google.com/u/1/apppasswords

In case you need to enable 2FA before you can follow these steps:
